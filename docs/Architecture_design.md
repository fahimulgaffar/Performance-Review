# Detailed Web Application Architecture

### Backend Server (server.js)
- **User Authentication:**
  - **Functionality:** Manages the entire user authentication process, including user registration, login, and session management. It issues authentication tokens for session validation.
  - **Endpoints:**
    - `/register` for new user signups. It handles user data validation, password hashing, and storing user credentials in the database.
    - `/login` manages user logins, authenticates credentials, and issues JWT tokens for session management.
    - `/logout` to terminate user sessions and invalidate tokens.
  - **Security:** Implements bcrypt for password hashing, ensuring secure storage of user credentials. Utilizes JWT for maintaining secure and stateless user sessions.

- **Review Management:**
  - **Functionality:** Facilitates operations related to user reviews, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting reviews.
  - **Endpoints:**
    - `/reviews/create` to post new user reviews. It validates review content and stores it in the database.
    - `/reviews/read` retrieves existing reviews from the database.
    - `/reviews/update` for updating user-submitted reviews.
    - `/reviews/delete` allows users to delete their reviews.
  - **Database Interaction:** Connects with MongoDB (or similar database) for persistent storage of user reviews. Utilizes Mongoose or similar ORM for database interaction.

### Frontend Application (React Components)
- **App Component (App.js):**
  - **State Management:** Manages global application state using React's Context API or Redux for handling user authentication status and profile data.
  - **User Interface:** Incorporates a responsive design utilizing CSS frameworks. Implements form validation and manages user input errors effectively.
  - **Interactions:** Handles user events like form submissions, navigation clicks, and handles communication with the backend via API calls.

- **Dashboard Component (Dashboard.js):**
  - **Review Handling:** Utilizes components such as cards or lists for displaying user reviews, with features like pagination and search functionality for efficient navigation.
  - **User Interaction:** Offers interactive UI elements for adding, editing, or deleting reviews, including confirmation dialogs for critical actions.
  - **Data Management:** Employs React hooks for local state management of reviews, drafts, and UI-related states.

### Testing (App.test.js)
- **Framework and Libraries:**
  - **Jest:** Used as the primary testing framework, offering a robust environment for writing and executing tests.
  - **React Testing Library:** Assists in testing React components in a user-centric way, focusing on how users interact with the application.
- **Test Cases:**
  - **User Authentication Tests:** Simulates user signup and login processes. Verifies that the application correctly handles user authentication, including token generation and session management.
  - **Dashboard Functionality Tests:** Ensures the Dashboard component renders as expected, with functional interactive elements. Validates the correct fetching of data and state updates upon user actions.
  - **Error Handling Tests:** Confirms that the application provides appropriate feedback and error messages in case of failed network requests or validation errors.

### Interaction and Interfaces:
- **Client-Server Communication:**
  - The frontend (Client) communicates with the backend (Server) via RESTful API calls. The backend serves as an interface between the frontend and the database, ensuring data consistency and secure transactions.
- **Authentication Flow:**
  - The frontend sends user credentials to the backend for authentication. Upon successful authentication, the backend issues a JWT, which the frontend stores and uses for subsequent requests to authenticate the user session.
- **Review Data Flow:**
  - The Dashboard component interacts with the backend to fetch, create, update, or delete reviews. It sends requests to the respective backend endpoints and updates the UI based on the responses received.
