## Arooz's assessment-
Sprint 2 feedback played a prominent role in highlighting the weak points and faults in the project. If the team had more time and fewer final exam commitments, the team could have worked to improve the project significantly.
- Docstring for the whole project could be improved and made clear for marker and teammates
- Team architectural design could have implemented the individual coding and design decisions a lot better.
- Code reviews should have been more thorough, and should have not just been limited to just finding the bugs and the completeness of the code, we should have thought more about the styling and how it fits in the overall project.
- We should have relied more upon documenting the issues in one of our project files instead of using group messages for highlighting a bug or issue or the next group meeting
- Feedback also made us aware that a lot more emphasis should be placed on the team-performance reviews, by highlighting not just the good points but also the inefficiencies and faults in the other teammate's work, it should provide others with advice on which they can improve on. The team did try to work on it but it depends greatly on each member's individual input and can not be always very definitive as it is highly opinionated. It could highlight the different mindsets in tackling a bug or making a design choice or choosing a feature.
- "Restructuring the website architecture into modular react components", as suggested by Libin Joji, could have helped make the project more modular and clearer role assignment.
- SCRUM meeting documentation could have been more specific and descriptive of the agendas and roles assigned, as we had very few meetings in the last few days, and it was very hard to implement.

It was also proposed to make a common team hypothetical file and has been implemented in the same folder as this file.
