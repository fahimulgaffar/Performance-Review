## Libin's assessment-
Based on the feedback received during sprint 2 and with an enhanced understanding of the react framework, one improvment suggestion involves restructuring the website architecture by dividing it into modular react components. This approach entails assigning each team member a distinct component to develop independently. By utilizing backend methods for communication between these components, we aimed to ensure a cohesive and well integrated program. Recognizing the potential benefits of this component based architecture, we acknowledge that its implementation would require us to rewrite our existing project. But due to the delay in sprint 2 feedbacks, time constraints and finals, we would not be able to complete the task given the short time period. While we are unable to rewrite the entire project, we understand and recognise the potential long term advantages to adopting a more modular and scalable architecture.
