Mike is an employer at Verafin who wants to use the site to view and post performance reviews.
As he logs on to the site, he tries to search for good reviews about potential employees.
He finds himself wanting to sort the reviews he sees by popularity or latest reviews.

Sorting reviews is a functionality that many users will want because it makes the user's search
much easier. This also revealed a secondary feature, which is up/down voting. This will improve
interactivity and ties in to the sorting feature.


## Arooz Singh: 
Dave is a small business owner who wants to use the site to view the user complaints for his business.
He is facing trouble signing in as he did not get any warning about how short or long his password should be.

Getting warning about the domain and constraints should be a useful feature to avoid potential bugs.


## Libin Joji:
Jeff is the head of a local convenience store and wants to use the site to keep track of the performance of different outlets. He would like to see a feature mention his status as the owner so as to maintain and respond to reviews over all his outlets. 


## Mamun Rashid:
Alex is a dedicated university student pursuing a challenging degree. He aspires to excel in his studies, but keeping track of his academic plan can be quite a task.
To simplify the process, he wishes for a website feature that would allow him to map out his entire academic plan, listing the required courses, prerequisites, and graduation timeline.
Such a feature would be invaluable for him to stay organized, ensuring he completes his degree on time while achieving his academic goals.
